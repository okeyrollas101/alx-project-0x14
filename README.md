# MoviesDatabase API Integration

This project integrates with the MoviesDatabase API to fetch and manage movie-related data. Below is the documentation for the API, including endpoints, authentication, and usage guidelines.

## API Overview

The MoviesDatabase API provides access to a comprehensive collection of movie data, including titles, release dates, ratings, cast, and more. Key features include:

- Fetching movie details by ID, title, or genre
- Searching for movies with filters (year, rating, etc.)
- Accessing actor/actress information
- Retrieving trending and upcoming movies

## API Version

The current version of the API is v1.

## Available Endpoints

- `GET /titles` - Retrieve a list of movie titles with optional filters
- `GET /titles/{id}` - Get detailed information about a specific movie
- `GET /search` - Search for movies by title, genre, or keyword
- `GET /trending` - Fetch currently trending movies
- `GET /upcoming` - Retrieve upcoming movie releases
- `GET /actors` - Get information about actors/actresses
- `GET /actors/{id}` - Get detailed information about a specific actor

## Request and Response Format

All requests should include:

- `Content-Type: application/json` header
- API key in the `X-API-KEY` header

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests:

Sign up at RapidApi and subscribe to the MoviesDatabase API

Use your X-RapidAPI-key in the headers.

Required Headers:

http
Copy
Edit
X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com
Without these headers, your requests will be rejected.

## Error Handling

The API may return various error responses:

Status Code	Meaning	Suggested Handling
401 Unauthorized	Missing or invalid API key	Ensure your API key is correct and included in headers
403 Forbidden	You don’t have permission	Check your API plan and request limits
404 Not Found	Resource doesn’t exist	Double-check the endpoint or parameters
429 Too Many Requests	Rate limit exceeded	Implement retries and respect rate limits
500 Internal Server Error	Server-side issue	Retry after a few seconds or report issue

### Best Practices for Error Handling:

Always check the response status code.

Use try-catch blocks in your code to handle errors gracefully.

Log errors for debugging and troubleshooting.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
Rate Limits:
Depending on your subscription tier, rate limits apply (e.g., 500 requests/day for free plans).

Best Practices:

Always cache frequent queries to reduce API calls.

Implement exponential backoff on 429 and 500 errors.

Validate and sanitize inputs to avoid unnecessary or invalid requests.

Monitor your usage via the RapidAPI dashboard.

Avoid excessive polling.

Use pagination to limit result size.
